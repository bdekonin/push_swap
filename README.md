# push_swap

This project is a work in progress and is an introduction to sorting algorithms. The goal is to sort a list of items according to a set of specific rules. You must do this with the least amount of swaps possible, and you will be given two stacks to sort from and can only switch between the two stacks. 

If you would like to contribute to this project, please reach out to us and let us know how you can help. We are open to all suggestions and are excited to see the progress we can make together.
